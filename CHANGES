--- Release 0.7.6, 24. Mar. 2003 --- See ChangeLog for details ---

2003-03-19  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Added option -useForeignDTD to dom parse and expat. Added
        domNode method 'precedes', to compare the relative order of
        two nodes out of the same document.

2003-02-22  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Added posteriori (DOM) validation capabilities. See the tnc
        man page for details.

2003-02-09  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Update to expat 1.95.6.    

2003-02-09  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Added 'systemId' and 'publicId' methods to the domDoc
        commands. Added flag -doctypeDeclaration to the asXML and
        asHTML methods of the domDoc commands.

        Changed the escaping while serializing XML data: in the past
        """ and "'" was escaped, now it isn't anymore. There isn't a
        clear rule (to the best of my knowledge) in any of the related
        specs about this, but now we do things almost along the lines,
        as saxon (which I regard as the currently most 'rule-setting'
        xslt processor) does it. In theory (from an XML viewpoint)
        this should not make a difference, but if somebody postprocess
        some tDOM output with other tools, there is a small risk, that
        things (slightly) breaks, therefor:
        *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

2002-12-28  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        The xslt method now understands also the options
          -ignoreUndeclaredParameters and -xsltmessagecmd.

2002-10-01  Zoran Vasiljevic  <zoran@archiware.com>

	The library file lib/tdomhtml.tcl is now moved to a separate
	package in "extensions" directory. This is a simple, yet very
	"clever" HTML generator, using advanced tdom HTML capabilities.
 	To use, please change to "extensions/tdomhtml" directory and 
	invoke "configure" followed by "make", followed by "make install".
        Be sure, however, to build and install the tdom package first.
