        The xslt method now understands also the options
          -ignoreUndeclaredParameters and -xsltmessagecmd.

	The library file lib/tdomhtml.tcl is now moved to a separate
	package in "extensions" directory. This is a simple, yet very
	"clever" HTML generator, using advanced tdom HTML capabilities.
 	To use, please change to "extensions/tdomhtml" directory and 
	invoke "configure" followed by "make", followed by "make install".
        Be sure, however, to build and install the tdom package first.
