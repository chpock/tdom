        * extensions/tnc/test.tcl: Updated to use new tDOM
          features. Made more usable.    

        * apps/xslt.tcl: Updated to using domDoc xslt method,
          -escapeNonASCII for asXML and as HTML and additionally
          -htmlEntities for asHTML.

	* generic/domxslt.c: Implemented "Forwards-Compatible
          rocessing" (XSLT rec 2.5), with limitations: xsl:version
          attributes on literal result elements are not
          supported. Fixed a bug in XPath func
          format-number(). XsltProcess now accepts also a
          domDoc. Improved the setting of the documentElement of the
          resultDoc.
