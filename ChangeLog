        * tests/dom.test: Added some tests for as yet not covered node
          methods.

        * tests/htmlreader.test: Minor fix: added tcltest cleanup.

        * generic/tcldom.c: Changed 'attributes' method to return the
          empty string as result for non element nodes, according to
          the DOM 2 rec, chapter "Interface Node". Fixed a seg fault
          in hasAttributeNS. Closed a mem leak in appendXML.

        * lib/tdom.tcl: Added simple debugging feature to
          tDOM::extRefHandler.

	* generic/tcldom.c: fixed UMR report from Purify

2002-11-12  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * win/makefile.vc
        * extensions/tnc/makefile.vc: Updated to the new version nr
          and the lib name convention of the new TEA 2 build system.

2002-11-09  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/tcldom.c: HTML serializer: No content escaping for
          the HTML tags script and style, according to XSLT rec
          16.2. Fixed a memory problem during interp deletion.

        * generic/dom.c
        * generic/domxpath.c: Minor changes.

2002-11-03  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * lib/tdom.tcl: tDOM::xmlOpenFile fix for files < 4 Byte size.    
        
        * generic/domxpath.c
        * generic/domxpath.h: Fixed ridiculously long runtime of
          certain // expr on certain documents. During analysis and
          testing, it turned out, that it would have been an even
          simpler approach, to simply expand the abbreviation // in
          the according productions. Though, the choosen implentation
          seems often to be (slightly) faster and is a start to
          collect experiences with early predicate evaluation.

2002-11-02  Zoran Vasiljevic  <zoran@archiware.com>

	* lib/tdomhtml.tcl: removed in favour of new tdom extension

	* extensions/tdomhtml: added new tdom extension for HTML
	  generation based on tdomhtml.tcl and internal tdom 
	  appendFromScript mechanism. This is a Tcl-only extension
	  which merely needs to be "make install"'ed.

	* Makefile.in: removed traces of tdomhtml.tcl file since it
	  now lives in its own extension

 	* configure.in:
	* configure: added TDOM_LD_SEARCH_FLAGS processing to help
	  runtime linker locate eventual custom shared libraries

2002-11-01  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * Makefile.in: Fixed 'missing separator' problem (using tab
          instead of white space).

        * lib/tdom.tcl: Updated function-available, corrected
          ridiculous typo by my (element-avaliable ->
          element-available). Somewhat fixed and updated
          element-available.

        * generic/domxpath.c
        * test/xpath.c: Full qualified XPath function names now are
          accepted as syntactical correct expr. The function call is
          resolved to the Tcl proc
          dom::xpathFunc::<namespaceURI>::<functionLocalname>.

        * generic/dom.c
        * generic/dom.h
        * generic/domxslt.c
        * generic/nodecmd.c
        * generic/tcldom.c
        * test/xpath.test: Fixed old problem with Combine Set XPath
          expressions and XSLT sorts on trees, in which new nodes are
          inserted after the initial parsing (doc order of result).
    
2002-10-31  Zoran Vasiljevic  <zoran@archiware.com>

	* lib/tdom.tcl: does now "package require tdom" only,
	  instead of "package provide tdom 0.7.5".
	  The "package provide" with a correct version is
 	  done by the C-module now (which is better).
	  Some cosmetic changes as well (keep 80-columns wide!).

  	* lib/tdomhtml.tcl: renamed version of domhtml.tcl
	  Also did some simplification in html2tcl, renamed some
	  internal private functions and added namespace-wide 
	  definitions of html command names. The _2tcl procedure
	  now creates the missing elementNode commands as it
	  parses the html code, on the fly.

	* Makefile.in: changed order of loads in the pkgIndex.tcl.
	  First the C-module is loaded, followed by the tdom.tcl 
	  library file, followed by the tdomhtml.tcl library file.
 	  Thus, the tdomhtml.tcl has become the first class citizen.

	* CHANGES: added this file

2002-10-31  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/tcldom.c
        * test/dom.test: Fixed argument check of domObj method
          documentElement. Fixed domNode method appendFromList (wrong
          list format could result in seg fault). Thanks to Oleg
          Oleinick, for reporting both problems.

        * generic/domxslt.c
        * generic/domxpath.c
        * generic/dom.c: Fixed mem leaks/possible invalid read
    
2002-10-30  Zoran Vasiljevic  <zoran@archiware.com>

	* generic/domxslt.c: added proper cast to arguments passed to
	  FREE() macro to avoid compiler barking at us.

2002-10-30  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/tcldom.c: Added -escapeNonASCII and -htmlEntities
          also to node_usage and domObj_usage.

        * extensions/tnc/test.tcl: Updated to use new tDOM
          features. Made more usable.    

        * apps/xslt.tcl: Updated to using domDoc xslt method,
          -escapeNonASCII for asXML and asHTML and additionally
          -htmlEntities for asHTML.

	* generic/domxslt.c: Implemented "Forwards-Compatible
          Processing" (XSLT rec 2.5), with limitations: xsl:version
          attributes on literal result elements are not
          supported. Fixed a bug in XPath func
          format-number(). XsltProcess now accepts also a
          domDoc. Improved the setting of the documentElement of the
          resultDoc.

2002-10-29  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

	* generic/tcldom.c:
        * doc/domDoc.*
        * doc/domNode.*: Added -escapeNonASCII as option to the asXML
          and asHTML methods and -htmlEntities as option to the asHTML
          method. Added "xslt" method to domDoc commands.

	* generic/dom.c: Better error reporting in case of parsing
          errors in external entities.

        * doc/expat.*: Fixed a documentation bug.
  
2002-10-29 Zoran Vasiljevic <zoran@archiware.com>

	* generic/tcldom.c
	* generic/nodecmd.c
	* generic/nodecmd.h: modified "dom createNodeCmd" to accept the
        -returnNodeCmd" optional argument. All commands created
	with this option willreturn the dom object command for accessing 
	the generated node.
	
	* ChangeLog: added this file
