        * Makefile.in: Fixed 'missing separator' problem (using tab
          instead of white space).

        * lib/tdom.tcl: Updated function-available, corrected
          ridiculous typo by my (element-avaliable ->
          element-available). Somewhat fixed and updated
          element-available.

        * generic/domxpath.c
        * test/xpath.c: Full qualified XPath function names now are
          accepted as syntactical correct expr. The function call is
          resolved to the Tcl proc
          dom::xpathFunc::<namespaceURI>::<functionLocalname>.

        * generic/dom.c
        * generic/dom.h
        * generic/domxslt.c
        * generic/nodecmd.c
        * generic/tcldom.c
        * test/xpath.test: Fixed old problem with Combine Set XPath
          expressions and XSLT sorts on trees, in which new nodes are
          inserted after the initial parsing (doc order of result).

	* lib/tdom.tcl: does now "package require tdom" only,
	  instead of "package provide tdom 0.7.5".
	  The "package provide" with a correct version is
 	  done by the C-module now (which is better).
	  Some cosmetic changes as well (keep 80-columns wide!).

  	* lib/tdomhtml.tcl: renamed version of domhtml.tcl
	  Also did some simplification in html2tcl, renamed some
	  internal private functions and added namespace-wide 
	  definitions of html command names. The _2tcl procedure
	  now creates the missing elementNode commands as it
	  parses the html code, on the fly.

	* Makefile.in: changed order of loads in the pkgIndex.tcl.
	  First the C-module is loaded, followed by the tdom.tcl 
	  library file, followed by the tdomhtml.tcl library file.
 	  Thus, the tdomhtml.tcl has become the first class citizen.

        * generic/tcldom.c
        * test/dom.test: Fixed argument check of domObj method
          documentElement. Fixed domNode method appendFromList (wrong
          list format could result in seg fault). Thanks to Oleg
          Oleinick, for reporting both problems.

        * generic/domxslt.c
        * generic/domxpath.c
        * generic/dom.c: Fixed mem leaks/possible invalid read

	* generic/domxslt.c: added proper cast to arguments passed to
	  FREE() macro to avoid compiler barking at us.

2002-10-30  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/tcldom.c: Added -escapeNonASCII and -htmlEntities
          also to node_usage and domObj_usage.

        * extensions/tnc/test.tcl: Updated to use new tDOM
          features. Made more usable.    

        * apps/xslt.tcl: Updated to using domDoc xslt method,
          -escapeNonASCII for asXML and asHTML and additionally
          -htmlEntities for asHTML.

	* generic/domxslt.c: Implemented "Forwards-Compatible
          Processing" (XSLT rec 2.5), with limitations: xsl:version
          attributes on literal result elements are not
          supported. Fixed a bug in XPath func
          format-number(). XsltProcess now accepts also a
          domDoc. Improved the setting of the documentElement of the
          resultDoc.

2002-10-29  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

	* generic/tcldom.c:
        * doc/domDoc.*
        * doc/domNode.*: Added -escapeNonASCII as option to the asXML
          and asHTML methods and -htmlEntities as option to the asHTML
          method. Added "xslt" method to domDoc commands.

	* generic/dom.c: Better error reporting in case of parsing
          errors in external entities.

        * doc/expat.*: Fixed a documentation bug.

	* generic/tcldom.c
	* generic/nodecmd.c
	* generic/nodecmd.h: modified "dom createNodeCmd" to accept the
        -returnNodeCmd" optional argument. All commands created
	with this option willreturn the dom object command for accessing 
	the generated node.
	
	* ChangeLog: added this file
