                      with the little help of:

                Rolf Ade         (rolf@pointsman.de)
                Zoran Vasiljevic (zoran@archiware.com)


This directory contains a freely distributable (under the Mozilla Public 
License) thread-safe extension to Tcl/Tk called tDOM.


tDOM contains:

    *  the newest version of Expat, the XML parser from James Clark,
       including namesspace and DTD support.

    *  a modified version of Steve Ball's Tclexpat, the Tcl interface to 
       expat, for event-like (SAX-like) XML parsing. The modifications
       are for performance improvements and to make the newest Expat
       features (XML namespace) available.

    *  a (partial) DOM implementation in C for maximum performance and
       minimum memory need following the W3C DOM Core Level 1 
       recommendation using a OO-like syntax.

    *  a XPath implementation in C following the November 99 W3C
       recommendation.

    *  a (partial) implementation in C of the XPointer (97) navigational 
       functions.

    *  UTF-8 to 8 bit encoding back conversion functionality to support
       Tcl version < 8.1x

    *  additional convinience methods
 
    *  documentation in TMML, HTML and nroff format


COMPILING/USING tDOM

    Depending on your platform, (unix or win) go to the corresponding
    directory and invoke the configure script:

        ../configure
        make 
        make test
        make install

    tDOM is TEA-compatible so you should be able to build the package
    using the MinGW build environment for Windows. There is also the
    MSVC nmake file so you can compile the package with Microsoft tools.


PLATFORMS
    HP-UX-10.20  with Tcl8.0.5   (both ansi cc and gcc)
    HP-UX-9.x
    Linux 2.2.5                  (egcs 2.91.66, Suse 6.1)
    Solaris 2.5.1+               (both gcc and SunWorks compilers)

    Other machines and OS's are not tested but should work too.
